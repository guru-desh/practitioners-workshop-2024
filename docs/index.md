# Learning @ Scale: Practitioners' Workshop

## Overview

Interest has surged in the computer science field fueled by lucrative career benefits and the more recent widespread adoption of large language models such as GPT-4 and AI-powered applications. This surge in interest has transformed the classroom. Where instructors once only had to engage with twenty to thirty students in a semester, enrollment numbers now task instructors with the education, assessment and oversight of hundreds to thousands of learners in both the physical and digital setting.

Hiring additional teaching staff can help alleviate some of the burden, but it is still all too easy for the classroom staff to be overwhelmed by administrative duties that could be efficiently and effectively managed through automated solutions. Furthermore, while the scaling challenges are always not fully unique to any particular classroom, the patchwork solutions implemented by the teaching staff typically are in an attempt to return the teaching environment to that of the smaller classrooms familiar and favored by most instructors.

**In this half-day workshop, we hope to begin a dialogue across classrooms about the challenges faced from a rapidly expanding student body.We plan to catalog a comprehensive list of these challenges, the tools internally developed to overcome these challenges, and the barriers to external adoption of these tools for the learning community at large.** We invite all classroom stakeholders to participate in this dialogue, both instructors and students, for the sake of improving classroom experience for all (All instructors from all grade levels and all disciplines are welcome to attend). **In order to keep having these conversations, we plan on creating a Discord channel and mailing list with interested participants at the workshop.** This channel also serves to create a set of experts that can help other users when they are interested in adopting new technologies that emerge from research.
